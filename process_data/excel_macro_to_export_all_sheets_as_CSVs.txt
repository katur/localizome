Step 1)
Macros do not work (at least on Katherine's computer) with as many Excel sheets as Miyeko's document has. 
So from her file, save new documents with only 50 sheets each 
(straightforward way: highlight tabs (hold down shift) at bottom of workbook, right click, 
select "move or copy", To book: "(new book)", select "Create a copy").

Step 2)
For each excel document with about 50 sheets, perform the following tasks 
to run a macro that saves each sheet as a separate csv.

Tools > Macro > Visual Basic Editor
double click on ThisWorkbook
paste the following into the code popup: "

Public Sub SaveWorksheetsAsCsv()

Dim WS As Excel.Worksheet
Dim SaveToDirectory As String

Dim CurrentWorkbook As String
Dim CurrentFormat As Long

 CurrentWorkbook = ThisWorkbook.FullName
 CurrentFormat = ThisWorkbook.FileFormat
' Store current details for the workbook

      SaveToDirectory = ""

      For Each WS In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
          WS.SaveAs WS.Name + ".csv", xlCSV
      Next

 Application.DisplayAlerts = False
  ThisWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=CurrentWorkbook, FileFormat:=CurrentFormat
 Application.DisplayAlerts = True
' Temporarily turn alerts off to prevent the user being prompted
'  about overwriting the original file.

End Sub
